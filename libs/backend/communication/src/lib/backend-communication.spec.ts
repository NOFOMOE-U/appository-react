//to do
// Integrating Aqua (Fluence Labs protocol) for peer-to-peer communication into your existing project involves several steps. Here's a general guide on how you can approach this integration:

// Installation:

// Begin by installing the Aqua SDK or library in your project. You can usually do this using a package manager like npm or yarn. Check the official Aqua documentation for specific installation instructions.
// Configuration:

// Configure Aqua with the necessary settings. This might involve providing authentication tokens, setting up network configurations, or any other parameters required for Aqua to work correctly.
// Initialization:

// Identify a suitable entry point in your backend code where Aqua should be initialized. This could be in your main server file (e.g., main.ts or server.ts). Initialize Aqua here, providing the necessary configurations.
// Injecting Aqua into GraphQL Resolvers:

// Since you're using GraphQL with Nexus, you'll want to inject Aqua into your GraphQL resolvers. This might involve creating middleware or decorators to wrap your resolver functions with Aqua functionality. Ensure that Aqua is seamlessly integrated into your existing GraphQL schema.
// Handling Communication Events:

// Aqua likely provides mechanisms for handling peer-to-peer communication events. Integrate these mechanisms into your existing controllers, services, or modules where peer-to-peer communication is required. For example, if you have a messaging feature, use Aqua to facilitate real-time communication between users.
// Testing and Debugging:

// Thoroughly test the integration to ensure that Aqua is working as expected. Pay attention to error handling, data synchronization, and any other aspects relevant to peer-to-peer communication. Use logging and debugging tools to troubleshoot any issues.
// Documentation:

// Update your project documentation to include information about the integration of Aqua. This should cover how it's used, any new APIs or functionalities introduced, and any specific considerations for developers working on the project.
// Version Control and Deployment:

// If your project uses version control (e.g., Git), make sure to commit and version the changes related to Aqua integration. Ensure that your deployment pipeline includes the necessary steps to deploy Aqua along with your application.
// Monitoring and Maintenance:

// Set up monitoring for Aqua to track its performance and identify any potential issues. Additionally, stay informed about updates or changes to the Aqua library and incorporate them into your project as needed.
// Remember to refer to the Aqua documentation for specific details on usage and integration with different frameworks or libraries. If Aqua provides any example projects or use cases, those can be valuable references for your integration.
