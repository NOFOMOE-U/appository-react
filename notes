  logging options to set up
  The options object can be anything that you want to pass to the module. It depends on what the module needs in order to function correctly. Here are some examples of options that could be added:

database connection settings
authentication settings
authorization settings
caching settings
environment variables
logging settings
feature toggles
default configuration values
Basically, anything that the module needs to configure itself or to operate correctly could be added as an option. It's up to you to decide what options are necessary for your specific use case.
