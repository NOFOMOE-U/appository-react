// Develop a feature allowing SQL files to be converted into CSV or PDF formats.
// User Interaction:

// Collaboration Features:
// Develop real-time collaboration tools allowing users to edit, share, and collaborate on documents.
// Commenting and Review:
// Implement commenting and review functionalities within documents to facilitate feedback.
// Reporting System:

// User Behavior Reports:
// Create a reporting system to generate insights based on user behavior and activities within the application.
// Security Reports:
// Establish reporting for monitoring security-related aspects, like access logs, authentication, and permissions.
// Future Extensibility:

// Library/Modules Creation:
// Develop specialized libraries for major functionalities like reports, collaboration, and document editing.
// Shared Modules:
// Use shared modules for common functionalities like logging, context, and authentication to maintain consistency across modules.
// Integration with Existing Modules:

// GraphQL and Prisma Integration:
// Ensure seamless integration with existing GraphQL and Prisma modules to incorporate new features.
// User Experience Enhancement:

// User-Friendly Interface:
// Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface for ease of document creation, editing, and collaboration.
// Testing and Quality Assurance:

// Unit and Integration Testing:
// Implement rigorous testing protocols to maintain the quality and stability of newly added features.
// Feedback Loop and Continuous Improvement:

// Gather User Feedback:
// Periodically collect feedback from users to identify areas of improvement and new features required.
// Iterative Development:
// Use an iterative approach to constantly refine and enhance functionalities based on feedback.
// Scaling and Performance:

// Optimization:
// Regularly optimize the system to ensure performance, especially when handling large documents or concurrent users.****








// Pagination and Filtering: Implement features for handling pagination and filtering of large API responses. This is useful when dealing with lists of data.

// Webhooks and Callbacks: Handle webhook callbacks or notifications from external APIs. This might involve processing incoming data and triggering actions in your application.

// Retry Strategies: Define strategies for handling retries, including exponential backoff, linear backoff, or custom strategies, depending on the external API's error behavior.

// Metadata and Indexing:

// Implement metadata for documents to store additional information (e.g., author, creation date, tags).
// Set up indexing to facilitate efficient document retrieval based on metadata.
// Access Control:

// Implement access control to define who can view, edit, or delete documents.
// Ensure that permissions are granular, allowing for both public and private documents.
// Versioning:

// Implement version control for documents to track changes over time.
// Consider using a versioning system or creating your own to manage document revisions.




















































//   //todo set up external document sharing
// //   PDF Generation: Libraries like PDFKit or jsPDF can help generate PDFs. Code might include structuring content, defining styles, and converting them into a PDF format.

// // Word Documents: For .docx files, the "docx" package in Node.js or libraries like "mammoth" can be used to create Word documents programmatically. This would involve structuring the document with the required content and formatting.

// // Markdown Files: Generating markdown is relatively simple, as it's a plain text format. Just organize the data in a markdown-specific way and save it with the ".md" extension.

// // Rich Text Format (RTF): Libraries like "rtf-creator" or "rich-text-rfc" can assist in creating RTF files. You'll need to structure the content and define the formatting.

  logging options to set up
  The options object can be anything that you want to pass to the module. It depends on what the module needs in order to function correctly. Here are some examples of options that could be added:

database connection settings
authentication settings
authorization settings
caching settings
environment variables
logging settings
feature toggles
default configuration values
Basically, anything that the module needs to configure itself or to operate correctly could be added as an option. It's up to you to decide what options are necessary for your specific use case.
