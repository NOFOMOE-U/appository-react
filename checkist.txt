. Editing Tools for Collaborative Documents
To provide editing tools similar to those in Google Docs, you'd likely need to integrate a text editor that supports collaborative editing. Some popular options include CKEditor, Quill, ProseMirror, and Draft.js. These libraries offer collaborative features and allow multiple users to edit a document simultaneously.

2. Shortcut Keys
Enabling shortcut keys for editing features can greatly enhance user experience. Most text editor libraries come with default shortcuts, but you can also create custom shortcuts for various functions. For instance, you can define shortcuts for bold, italic, underline, indenting, or bullet points.

3. Feature Options for Your App
Considering your app's focus on collaborative document management and team communication, features could include:

Real-time Collaboration: Allowing multiple users to edit a document simultaneously.
Document Version Control: Tracking changes and managing different versions of documents.
Integrated Communication: Incorporating chat, voice, and video communication within the app for seamless collaboration.
Task Management: Offering tools to assign tasks within documents, tag users, set deadlines, and track progress.

These features can significantly elevate the user experience and differentiate your app from others.

The provided code seems to focus on user authentication, socket communication, 
and request handling. To integrate these into the described functionalities, you may need to consider various APIs, 
libraries, and toolkits, possibly like Socket.IO, Axios for API communication, and possibly OAuth or JWT for user authentication. This integration will depend on your tech stack, such as React, Node.js, and the front-end libraries you choose.
